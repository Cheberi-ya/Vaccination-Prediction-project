# **VACCINE PREDICTION PROJECT**
## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
### OVERVIEW
H1N1, commonly referred to as swine flu, is a subtype of the influenza A virus that can infect humans, birds, and pigs. The virus gained widespread attention in 2009 when a new strain emerged, leading to the first influenza pandemic in over four decades. This novel H1N1 strain was particularly concerning due to its rapid human-to-human transmission and its ability to infect individuals across a wide age range, including those without preexisting conditions.

During the pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared H1N1 a global health emergency. Vaccination efforts were a critical component of the public health response, aimed at mitigating severe cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities. Despite these efforts, vaccine uptake varied significantly across populations due to a combination of logistical challenges, misinformation, and vaccine hesitancy.

Although the pandemic officially ended in August 2010, H1N1 has since become a seasonal flu virus, contributing to annual influenza epidemics. Understanding the factors influencing vaccine acceptance remains a priority for public health authorities to improve vaccination rates and enhance preparedness for future outbreaks
### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Vaccination rates are lower than desired, leading to preventable disease outbreaks.
### OBJECTIVES
- To analyze which demographic aspects (e.g.age, education) most influence vaccine uptake.
- To evaluate the attitudinal features affecting vaccine use.
- To build a machine learning model to predict whether an individual will take a vaccine based on demographic and attitudinal factors.
